###FAV Machine
Too busy for running your own Twitter account and too cheap to hire a Community Manager? Fav Machine is a tool I've written to increase awareness of Calloud, through massively favoriting tweets that talk about keywords related to it. So far, it's worked as a nice way to increase my follower base and to acquire more visits to Calloud's website.

To get it working you must have Go installed, and you will need to register the app on Twitter's Dev Portal in order to obtain the tokens that are required for using this tool.

Note: I've found that Twitter only lets me create 1000 favs/day. YMMV as this figure might be a function of how many follow{ings,ers} you already have.
